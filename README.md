# AR Gamified Drums

An AR project built in Unity designed to aid in teaching the drums, incorporating motion captured action observation methods and gamification elements similar to those found in a rhythm game. Designed for use with a Meta Quest 3 headset.

Currently WIP, screenshots and more information will be available here as the project progresses.
